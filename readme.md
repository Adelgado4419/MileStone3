# Technologies Used

**Git** - Used for version control of our code

**Github** - Used to host our code and allowed us be able to Push, Pull and Merge our code.

**Render** -  We used Render to deploy our code. It is what gives us the ability to have the following website active.


**Supabase** - This site is what hosts our BucketList data online. This website allows us to push and pull data to and from our Azure web app. 

**VSCode** -  This is a code editor that we used to build, edit and test code. VSCode comes with additional extensions like nodemon that allow us to test code. It also comes with a spell code for code as well, which is super useful with identifying bugs.
